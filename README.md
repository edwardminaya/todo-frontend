# To Do Application - Frontend REACT

This is a Todo frontend using React. The goal is to create the frontend that has the CRUD actions for users.

# Installation

Clone this repository onto your machine. Ensure that you are able to run React on your machine. If you need a backend see this link to get that started [Backend](https://github.com/edwardminaya/todo-api)

Once the repository is on your machine get into the folder on your terminal and run teh following commands

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

These commands will start the server. Go to your browser (I use google chrome) and go to this url, http://localhost:5173
You will be able to see the application and it should be pulling in data from the backend when both servers are running.
