# Installation

Clone this repository onto your machine. Ensure that you are able to run React on your machine. If you need a backend see this link to get that started [Backend](https://github.com/edwardminaya/todo-api)

Make sure to configure the rack-cors gem to allow web requests from localhost:5173 [instructions](https://gist.github.com/peterxjang/77d6243cf85103b027a56b401b62b289)

Once the repository is on your machine get into the folder on your terminal and run teh following commands

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

These commands will start the server. Go to your browser (I use google chrome) and go to this url, http://localhost:5173
You will be able to see the application and it should be pulling in data from the backend when both servers are running.
